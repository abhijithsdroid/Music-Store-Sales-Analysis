🎵 Music Store Sales Analysis (SQL Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a digital music store using PostgreSQL to uncover insights related to revenue trends, customer behavior, genre popularity, and artist performance.
The goal is to demonstrate SQL proficiency while translating raw data into actionable business insights.

This is a portfolio project designed to reflect real-world analytical thinking rather than isolated SQL exercises.

🎯 Business Problem

The music store operates across multiple countries with a diverse catalog of artists and genres.
Despite having detailed transactional data, the business lacks clarity on:

Where revenue is generated geographically

Whether sales are growing or seasonal

Which customers, genres, and artists drive profitability

How music preferences vary across countries

Whether revenue is overly dependent on top artists

Without this understanding, decisions around marketing, promotions, catalog expansion, and pricing remain inefficient.

🧠 Objectives

Analyze overall sales performance and trends

Identify top-performing countries, cities, and customers

Understand customer retention and spending behavior

Evaluate genre and artist contribution to revenue

Assess revenue concentration risk

Provide data-driven business recommendations



🗂️ Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on a relational database containing:

customer

invoice, invoice_line

track, album, artist

genre, media_type

playlist, playlist_track

Primary and foreign key constraints ensure data integrity.

📊 Key Analyses Performed
1️⃣ Revenue Trend Analysis

Monthly revenue shows clear seasonality

Sales peak during early and late-year months

2️⃣ Geographic Performance

Revenue is heavily concentrated in the USA

Strong secondary markets include Canada and Europe

Emerging markets like Brazil and India show growth potential

3️⃣ City-Level Insights

Top revenue cities include Prague, London, Berlin, Paris, and Mountain View

4️⃣ Customer Behavior

100% repeat customers, indicating exceptional retention

A small group of customers drives disproportionate revenue

5️⃣ Genre Performance

Rock dominates globally, generating the highest revenue

Genre preferences vary by country

6️⃣ Artist & Catalog Analysis

Iconic artists dominate purchases

Top 10 artists contribute ~28.6% of total revenue, indicating moderate concentration

7️⃣ Track-Level Insights

A few tracks and albums drive high engagement

Opportunity for playlist-based promotions

🔑 Key Findings

Sales are seasonal but stable over time

Revenue is geographically concentrated but diversified across artists

Customer retention is extremely strong

Rock is the core revenue-driving genre globally

Markets differ in genre maturity and diversity

Revenue dependency on top artists is present but manageable

💼 Business Recommendations

Use seasonal promotions to stabilize low-performing months

Focus marketing on high-revenue countries and cities

Introduce tiered loyalty programs for high-value customers

Maintain Rock as the flagship genre while supporting niche genres

Apply localized genre strategies by country

Diversify artist exposure to reduce long-term revenue risk

📌 Limitations

No marketing cost or streaming behavior data

Analysis is based on historical sales only

🚀 Future Enhancements

Build interactive dashboards (Tableau / Power BI)

Perform customer cohort and lifetime value analysis

Forecast sales using time-series models

Analyze cross-genre customer behavior

🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL-driven analysis can transform transactional data into meaningful business insights.
By analyzing revenue trends, customer behavior, and catalog performance, the music store can make informed decisions to drive growth, reduce risk, and improve customer engagement.
